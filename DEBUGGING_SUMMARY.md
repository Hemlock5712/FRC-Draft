## 🛠️ Debugging Tools Available

### Admin Interface (`/admin/matchups-admin`)

1. **TBA Connection Test** 🔍
   - Tests API connectivity
   - Validates API key
   - Shows connection status

2. **Debug Single Event** 🐛
   - Tests TBA data processing with a single event
   - Processes only 5 teams for quick testing
   - Shows detailed processing results

3. **Fetch Real TBA Data** 📡
   - Fetches actual historical FRC data
   - Processes multiple events for a week
   - Creates team performances and weekly scores

4. **Generate Test Data** 🎲
   - Creates realistic fake data for testing
   - Generates team performances across multiple weeks
   - Populates user rosters with teams

### Backend Debug Functions

1. **`testTBAConnectionAction`**
   ```typescript
   // Tests TBA API connectivity
   const result = await testTBAConnectionAction({});
   ```

2. **`debugTBAEventProcessingAction`**
   ```typescript
   // Debug single event processing
   const result = await debugTBAEventProcessingAction({
     eventKey: "2024mndu",
     year: 2024,
     week: 1
   });
   ```

3. **`debugTeamPerformanceAction`**
   ```typescript
   // Debug team performance calculation
   const result = await debugTeamPerformanceAction({
     eventKey: "2024mndu"
   });
   ```

## 🔧 Common Debugging Scenarios

### 1. TBA API Issues

**Symptoms:**
- "TBA_AUTH_KEY not set" errors
- API connection failures
- No events found for week

**Debug Steps:**
1. Click "🔍 Test TBA Connection" in admin
2. Check API key in environment variables
3. Verify internet connectivity
4. Try different weeks (1-6 have most events)

**Solutions:**
- Add TBA API key to `.env.local`
- Use hardcoded key for testing (already in code)
- Check TBA API status at thebluealliance.com

### 2. Data Processing Issues

**Symptoms:**
- No team performances created
- Weekly scores not calculating
- Teams not found in database

**Debug Steps:**
1. Use "🐛 Debug Single Event" to test processing
2. Check console logs for detailed error messages
3. Verify team data exists in database
4. Test with known good event keys

**Solutions:**
- Generate test data first if no real data
- Clear and regenerate data if corrupted
- Use smaller batch sizes for processing

### 3. Draft Room Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Picking gets stuck
- Teams not appearing in search
- Roster not updating

**Debug Steps:**
1. Check draft room status in database
2. Verify user permissions
3. Test with fresh draft room
4. Check WebSocket connections

**Solutions:**
- Reset draft room status if stuck
- Clear browser cache and reload
- Use admin tools to populate test data

## 📊 Data Flow Overview

```
TBA API → fetchRealTBADataAction → processEventDataFromTBA → 
teamEventPerformances → calculateWeeklyScores → weeklyTeamScores →
calculateLeagueWeeklyScores → leagueWeeklyScores → standings
```

## 🚀 Performance Optimizations

1. **Parallel Processing**
   - Database queries run in parallel where possible
   - Team data fetched concurrently
   - Batch operations for large datasets

2. **Smart Limits**
   - 1000 picks max per query
   - 100 participants max per room
   - 5 events max per TBA fetch
   - 25 teams per chunk for generation

3. **Caching & Optimization**
   - Team lookup maps for O(1) access
   - Conditional queries based on user state
   - Efficient database indexing

## 🔍 Monitoring & Logs

### Console Logs to Watch
- `Debug: Testing TBA processing for event...`
- `Mutation (processFetchedTeams): Importing chunk...`
- `Action: Fetched TBA page X, Status: Y`

### Key Metrics
- Team performances created per week
- Weekly scores calculated
- Draft pick response times
- WebSocket connection stability

## 📝 Next Steps for Further Development

1. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Add retry logic for failed API calls
   - Implement circuit breakers for external services
   - Add user-friendly error messages

2. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Add performance metrics dashboard
   - Monitor query execution times
   - Track user engagement metrics

3. **Advanced Features**
   - Real-time notifications for trades
   - Advanced analytics and projections
   - Mobile app optimization

## 🆘 Emergency Debugging

If the system is completely broken:

1. **Reset Everything:**
   ```bash
   # Clear all team data
   Use "Clear ALL Team Data" in admin
   
   # Generate fresh test data
   Use "Generate Week X Data" for each week 1-6
   
   # Populate test rosters
   Use "Populate Test Rosters"
   ```

2. **Check Core Systems:**
   - Database connectivity (Convex dashboard)
   - Authentication (Clerk dashboard)
   - API keys (environment variables)

3. **Fallback to Test Data:**
   - Use generated data instead of TBA data
   - Create simple draft rooms for testing
   - Use admin tools to simulate scenarios
